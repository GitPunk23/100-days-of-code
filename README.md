## Overview
The purpose behind the #100DaysofCode is to build skills through practice everyday. The general idea is that over a course of 100 days, one is to work on whatever their chosen skill is for at least an hour per day. Naturally at the end, you would have built up more and more of the skill.

I'm taking part so that I can further my education while I complete my degree and keep my skills tight into my professional life afterwards. The challenge gives me a reason to work on projects both simple and with a larger purpose, not just to build and demo skills, but with the idea that I'm creating for someone or something's benefit.

All of my progress will be documented within logs, which you can find in the following section, and my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeonStar_dev). To learn more, please check out the [#100DaysofCode Repository](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code).

Thank you for checking out my journey!
