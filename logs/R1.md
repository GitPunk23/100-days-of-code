    * Data Structures and Algorithms

## Day 1 - May 4, 2022
Started work on a GitHub workflow that would automate my daily tweet. Found out I'm jumping in too quick and it'll probably take a little more time to figure out than I thought. I found several actions that have already been created but I think I might have to create my own because of the way I want it formatted. Putting that project back on the shelf for now, I'll break it back out. Glad to have finally started on this journey however!

## Day 2 - May 5, 2022
Jumped back onto my [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) account and finished the Javascript course! I'm working my way through the Web Development course which I plan to finish this Summer! 

I already had progress completed in this course so where I picked up today dealt with objects. Being used to Java, getting the syntax down is still taking a bit, but I think I like the way JS handles it. Tomorrow I'll continue the webdev course by working on the post course projects for JS and starting into the "Building Interactive JavaScript Websites" module!

## Day 3 - May 6, 2022
Seemed to be some connection issues going on today, whether it was on my end or [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) I'm not sure. I pushed through the first section of the "Build Interactive Websites with JS" module though! today I learned how to target HTML elements with JS. I've had some practice with this before in a class a few semester back but we didn't spend nearly enought time in my opinion going over the DOM. I feel like I've got the basics down when it comes to targeting elements with Javascript and it would probably be best to start a project to practice even further!
