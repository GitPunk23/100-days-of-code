# 100 Days of Code | Round 1
### May 4, 2022 - August 11, 2022
### What I'm targeting
* Languages
    * C++
    * Javascript/Web Development 
    * Python
* Skills
    * Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
    * Data Structures and Algorithms

## Day 1 - May 4, 2022
Started work on a GitHub workflow that would automate my daily tweet. Found out I'm jumping in too quick and it'll probably take a little more time to figure out than I thought. I found several actions that have already been created but I think I might have to create my own because of the way I want it formatted. Putting that project back on the shelf for now, I'll break it back out. Glad to have finally started on this journey however!

## Day 2 - May 5, 2022
Jumped back onto my [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) account and finished the Javascript course! I'm working my way through the Web Development course which I plan to finish this Summer! 

I already had progress completed in this course so where I picked up today dealt with objects. Being used to Java, getting the syntax down is still taking a bit, but I think I like the way JS handles it. Tomorrow I'll continue the webdev course by working on the post course projects for JS and starting into the "Building Interactive JavaScript Websites" module!

## Day 3 - May 6, 2022
Seemed to be some connection issues going on today, whether it was on my end or [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) I'm not sure. I pushed through the first section of the "Build Interactive Websites with JS" module though! today I learned how to target HTML elements with JS. I've had some practice with this before in a class a few semester back but we didn't spend nearly enought time in my opinion going over the DOM. I feel like I've got the basics down when it comes to targeting elements with Javascript and it would probably be best to start a project to practice even further!

## Day 4 - May 7, 2022
Continuing on with the Web Dev course, I dealt with more JS events today. I got to play around with the different kinds of events that can be fired including mouse events and keypress events. Pretty simple stuff but it was a nice review! As for new material, I also covered handlebars.js today. The handlebars library allows you to edit HTML documents through javascript and even includes conditional handling within HTML. I feel like this makes a lot of concepts I had thought before as difficult, seem a lot easier. Ready to move on to Intermediate Javascript from here!

## Day 5 - May 8, 2022
Given that today is Mother's Day, I wasn't able to spend a lot of time here today. Made the most of it and pressed forward a bit though! Today I reviewed some JS documentation and practiced some of what I've been doing the last few days. I really like JavaScript but I'm not sure I see myself sticking with it for a future career. That could change as I get into some frameworks though, excited to continue on!

## Day 6 - May 9, 2022
Continued my progress in the web development course. Today I finished the module on classes which was essentially review to me. In previous classes at school I never struggled much with most of the concepts of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). The module basically demonstrated how to create classes and subclasses and then how to use inheritance between them. Even though I've got this stuff down its always good to practice! I will say that the JS syntax seems extra wordy coming from Java development.

The rest of this week I plan to clean up what I can on this web dev course, maybe even finishing it if possible, as next week is when my Summer semester begins. This Summer I'll be more focused on C++ development and learning my data structures and algorithms, the latter being something I am ready to learn with cautious excitement. As for C++, it is where I started in programming once I got to school and I'm excited to get back into it. I'm interested to see if I prioritize it over using Java. 

## Day 7 - May 10, 2022
Played around with modules today and how to use them both with ES6 and Node.js. Spent quite a bit of time reviewing as some of this initially came across as tricky. I need to keep practicing with exporting and importing from modules as some of the projects within the course tripped me up a little bit. 

I then took a little break and started loosely planning out an idea my partner and I came up with to help us plan our meals. I really like the idea and definitely need to start adding some projects to Github to demo for later!

## Day 8 - May 11, 2022
Continued planning out the meal prepping idea. Got an idea for what kind of functions I need and breaking down the bigger concepts behind what I'm actually doing. Currently juggling back and forth whether to use a relational database for the backend or just simple object creation. Additionally I'm juggling between using Java or C++ so that I can make additions as I learn more learning C++ development this Summer. 

## Day 9 - May 12, 2022
Continued onward with the web development and planning out my meal prepping app. I decided that I'll go ahead and implement it with C++ so that I have an instructor to bounce ideas off of to really improve it. Additionally I started refamiliaring myself with C++ syntax as it has been at least 2 years since I last wrote any code using it. Probably how I'll spend the rest of the weekend leading up to class starting next week. I'm not exactly sure how prepared I'm expected to be going into this course but I believe the more advanced classes I've already taken weren't pre-reqs. Leads me to worry one way or the other that A.) I might struggle a bit at the start or B.) the class might be a bit below where I currently am and I won't get as much out of it. We'll see though, I'm excited to move into it regardless!

## Day 10 - May 13, 2022
It's already been 10 days, that's crazy! I had a feeling this would go fast. While I know I am definitely learning new things at least with Javascript, I don't feel like I've made huge noteworthy progress yet. Hopefully at Day 20 I have something cool to show off!

Today I finished the Intermediate JavaScript module! Just a quick rundown of the things I reviewed:

* Practiced debugging
* Reviewed error types
* Try... catch error handling
* Promises
* Async... await
* Fetch API requests 

I have experience with threads in Java which didn't take long for me to pick up on so this came rather easily as well! Playing with API's was something I wanted to practice more this summer after having some projects based around it last semester. The GET and POST requests are a bit higher level than I was expecting so some more review will definitely be needed there.

## Day 11 - May 14, 2022
Today I breezed through the command line and github modules. Considering I'm doing all of my updating of this repo, and even this file, through bash I didn't find any particular difficulty there. I did start thinking about new ways to automate my process here though and I think I'll give that another shot since the git workflow didn't work. 

The github articles were interesting and I especially liked the pull requests section. I'm nervous to get into collaborative work but I'm going to have to at some point. I also really enjoyed learning about Github pages. That's something I could see myself using sooner rather than later.
