## Day 1 - May 4, 2022
Started work on a GitHub workflow that would automate my daily tweet. Found out I'm jumping in too quick and it'll probably take a little more time to figure out than I thought. I found several actions that have already been created but I think I might have to create my own because of the way I want it formatted. Putting that project back on the shelf for now, I'll break it back out. Glad to have finally started on this journey however!
