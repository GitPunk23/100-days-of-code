* Skills
    * Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
    * Data Structures and Algorithms

## Day 1 - May 4, 2022
Started work on a GitHub workflow that would automate my daily tweet. Found out I'm jumping in too quick and it'll probably take a little more time to figure out than I thought. I found several actions that have already been created but I think I might have to create my own because of the way I want it formatted. Putting that project back on the shelf for now, I'll break it back out. Glad to have finally started on this journey however!

## Day 2 - May 5, 2022
Jumped back onto my [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) account and finished the Javascript course! I'm working my way through the Web Development course which I plan to finish this Summer! 

I already had progress completed in this course so where I picked up today dealt with objects. Being used to Java, getting the syntax down is still taking a bit, but I think I like the way JS handles it. Tomorrow I'll continue the webdev course by working on the post course projects for JS and starting into the "Building Interactive JavaScript Websites" module!

## Day 3 - May 6, 2022
Seemed to be some connection issues going on today, whether it was on my end or [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) I'm not sure. I pushed through the first section of the "Build Interactive Websites with JS" module though! today I learned how to target HTML elements with JS. I've had some practice with this before in a class a few semester back but we didn't spend nearly enought time in my opinion going over the DOM. I feel like I've got the basics down when it comes to targeting elements with Javascript and it would probably be best to start a project to practice even further!

## Day 4 - May 7, 2022
Continuing on with the Web Dev course, I dealt with more JS events today. I got to play around with the different kinds of events that can be fired including mouse events and keypress events. Pretty simple stuff but it was a nice review! As for new material, I also covered handlebars.js today. The handlebars library allows you to edit HTML documents through javascript and even includes conditional handling within HTML. I feel like this makes a lot of concepts I had thought before as difficult, seem a lot easier. Ready to move on to Intermediate Javascript from here!

## Day 5 - May 8, 2022
Given that today is Mother's Day, I wasn't able to spend a lot of time here today. Made the most of it and pressed forward a bit though! Today I reviewed some JS documentation and practiced some of what I've been doing the last few days. I really like JavaScript but I'm not sure I see myself sticking with it for a future career. That could change as I get into some frameworks though, excited to continue on!
